  <h1>THE COMPLETE TALES AND POEMS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE</h1>
  <h2>An Enigma</h2>
  <h3> by Edgar Allan Poe</h3>
  <p>"Seldom we find," says Solomon Don Dunce, <br>
"Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet. <br>
Through all the flimsy things we see at once <br>
As easily as through a Naples bonnet- <br>
Trash of all trash!--how can a lady don it? <br>
Yet heavier far than you Petrarchan stuff-- <br>
Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff <br>
Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it." <br>
And, veritably, Sol is right enough. <br>
The general tuckermanities are arrant <br>
Bubbles--ephemeral and so transparent-- <br>
But this is, now,--you may depend upon it--<br>
Stable, opaque, immortal--all by dint <br>
Of the dear names that lie concealed within't.</p>
